# Bot-InstaAutoLike
A Javascript Bot to Auto Like all pictures in an Instagram profile.  
It bypasses Instagram spam protection and keeps retrying upon encountering the limits (limits of like frequency / limits of likes).  

**Usage :**  
**(1).** Open the Instagram profile whose pic you want to like in the browser.  
**(2).** Copy-Paste the code from **Bot-InstaAutoLike.js** in Browser Console or save the code as a bookmark (click it to run).  

After liking all the pics, it just refreshes the page.  

That's all folks!

**CAUTION :**  
1. More than 2 hours of continuous usage will give you a **'suspicious activity message' from Instagram** where you'll be asked to **reset your password**.  
Give breaks while using it, if you do not want to be forced to reset you password.  
2. Continuous usage of this tool for hours will get you temporarily banned from liking any pictures.
